# make-a-wish

Website name: "I Wish"
Main point: Users can submit ideas for apps that they wish were available.

Front-end: Black background, glass-style boilerplate grid cards with round edges, purple borderlines around the grid cards, menu nav header with "Add My Wish" button, sign-up button, and sign-in button at the top right corner of the nav menu bar.

Wishes: Users can write about apps they wish were available, such as an app that totals their Uber rides or an app that alerts them when their bill is due.

Website: "I Wish" is a platform that allows users to submit short forms which ask them "What type of apps do you wish were created?" Once the user presses submit, the wish they wrote will show on the front page of the "I Wish" website.

Grid cards: The website will showcase 30 grid cards boilerplates that are round-edged, glass-looking, with a heart icon at the bottom right corner, fully responsive.

User interaction: When a user reads one of the boilerplate grid cards, they can press the heart icon, which will change from being unfilled to being filled with red color, and the heart icon will grow once hovered over it. Once clicked, the grid card boilerplate will be counted, and the more times a user clicks on a heart on a certain grid card boilerplate, the number will decrease, which will be counted.

Sorting: The grid cards boilerplates with the highest count of heart clicks will show at the top of the "I Wish" page, and the grid cards boilerplates with the lowest heart click counts will remain at the bottom of the boilerplate grid cards.

Navigation: The website will have a black nav menu header with a button at the top right corner that says "Submit My Wish," and also a sign-in button and a sign-up button.
